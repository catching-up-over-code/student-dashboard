# briefing about project student-dashboard

## deets
Project name: student-dashboard\
Project code: studdash

## what are we going to do?
check [Projects](../../projects) and [Issues](https://github.com/catching-up-over-code/student-dashboard/issues) pages
- [ ] create calendar methods

## why?
cause why not? a dashboard that a student can look at before starting the day too see what they need to do that day. and what's closing in soon.
pretty close to what @Pro-xlr8 has in mind for the mobile application. but this will be cui-based and good practice for working with Python classes.

## how?
for the first time, let's all work on the same branch and see how it goes. we'll start on different files for now. each of us doing a different task on the same branch on different files.

**NB:** the ```master``` branch is not to be edited ever.\
all coding will be done in the ```dev``` branch.

* so clone the ```dev``` branch directly 
```
git clone https://github.com/catching-up-over-code/student-dashboard.git -b dev
```
**PS: remember to use ```git pull``` and ```git push``` frequently**
